# Grip: The financial diet that sticks.

**Grip** is a privacy-first, AI-powered financial companion designed to convert raw banking communications into structured, actionable insights without compromising user privacy. With **Hybrid Manual-First** capabilities, credit card lifecycle intelligence, and predictive analytics.

## 🚀 How It Works

Grip acts as a central hub for your financial life, utilizing a multi-stage pipeline to process data:

1.  **Ingestion**: Receives banking emails via three methods:
    *   **Direct Push**: A Google Apps Script pings the backend with raw email content.
    *   **Manual Pull**: The backend fetches new emails using OAuth2 credentials.
    *   **Manual Entry**: You can manually record transactions (e.g., Cash, Credit Card) which are automatically marked as `VERIFIED`.
2.  **Sanitization**: Before reaching any AI model, the raw text is processed by a **PII Sanitizer**. This regex-based engine masks sensitive data like PAN cards, Aadhaar numbers, Credit Card numbers, and UPI IDs.
3.  **Intelligence extraction**: The "Brain" (powered by **Groq Llama 3**) analyzes the sanitized text to extract structured JSON data:
    *   Amount & Currency
    *   Merchant Name
    *   Category & Sub-Category
    *   Account Type (Savings, Credit Card, etc.)
4.  **Deduplication**: A SHA-256 hash of the unique message ID and internal timestamp ensures no transaction is ever processed twice.
5.  **Memory (Merchant Mapping)**: When you manually verify a transaction, the engine creates a "Merchant Mapping." Future transactions from that same merchant are automatically categorized based on your past preferences.
6.  **Insights**: A dedicated dashboard provides real-time visibility into your Liquidity and Investment portfolio.
7.  **Predictive Forecasting**: Leverages a **Hybrid AI Engine** (Meta Prophet locally, or Groq Llama 3 on Vercel) to analyze historical spending patterns and category trends. It predicts your **month-end burden** (remaining expenses for the current month) to calculate a dynamic "Safe-to-Spend" margin.
8.  **PWA Ready**: Install Grip on your mobile device as a Progressive Web App for a native-like experience with offline capabilities.

## ✨ Core Functionalities

### 🏦 Transaction Management
- **Verification Workflow**: Transactions start as `PENDING`. You can approve, reject, or adjust them.
- **Merchant Memory**: Automatically maps raw merchant strings to clean, user-defined display names and categories.
- **Hybrid Manual-First**: Support for both automated email parsing and manual transaction entry.
- **Surety Tracking**: Mark recurring bills (rent, utilities) as "surety" for better burden calculation.

### 💳 Credit Card Intelligence
- **Card Management**: Register multiple credit cards with billing cycle details (statement date, payment due date).
- **Billing Cycle Tracking**: Automatically calculates current billing cycle, unbilled amount, and days until statement.
- **Cycle Notifications**: Get alerts X days before your billing cycle closes.
- **Utilization Monitoring**: Track credit utilization percentage against your credit limit.
- **Transaction Linking**: Link credit card transactions to specific cards for accurate cycle tracking.

### 📋 Bill Management & "Surety" Intelligence
- **Bill Tracking**: Create one-time or recurring bills with due dates.
- **Surety Bills**: Identify predictable recurring bills (rent, utilities, maintenance).
- **Burden Calculation**: Formula: `Frozen Funds = UnpaidBills + ProjectedSuretyBills + CurrentUnbilledCC`
- **Upcoming Bills**: View all unpaid bills due in the next X days.
- **Payment Tracking**: Mark bills as paid/unpaid.

### 🔄 Multi-Source Sync
- **Google Apps Script Webhook**: Secure production-ready endpoint for real-time transaction ingestion.
- **Legacy OAuth Sync**: Fallback method for manual history fetching using Google API Client.
- **X-GRIP-SECRET**: Header-based authentication for secure webhook communication.

### 📉 Predictive Analytics & Hybrid Forecasting
- **Hybrid AI Engine**: 
    - **Meta Prophet**: Uses high-performance statistical time-series forecasting for deep local analysis of daily spending totals.
    - **Groq LLM Intelligence**: seamlessly provides **category-level breakdowns** and **context-aware reasoning** (e.g., "Trending up due to weekend dining") for the forecasted amounts.
- **Month-End Precision**: specific forecasting for the *remaining days* of the current month, ensuring you don't overspend before your next paycheck.
- **Credit Card Bill Prediction**: Analyzes previous spending patterns and unbilled transactions to estimate upcoming credit card liabilities.
- **Variance Analysis**: Compare current month-to-date spending vs. last month-to-date with category-level breakdowns.
- **Percentage Metrics**: Calculate % over/under for total spend and category-specific spend.
- **Spend Analysis**: Breaks down historical data to identify "Sure Bills" (recurring rent, utilities, maintenance) and calculate a reliable "Safe-to-Spend" limit.

### 💰 Safe-to-Spend Intelligence
- **Real-Time Calculation**: `Safe-to-Spend = Balance - FrozenFunds - Buffer`
- **Frozen Funds Breakdown**: See exactly what's locked (unpaid bills, projected surety, unbilled CC).
- **Configurable Buffer**: Set your own safety buffer percentage (default 10%).
- **Visual Health Indicators**: Intuitive color-coded states (Critical, Warning, Healthy) with negative balance alerts.
- **Smart Recommendations**: Get actionable advice based on your spending capacity.

### 🛡️ Privacy & Security
- **Local-First Sanitization**: Sensitive data is masked *locally* before being sent to any third-party AI APIs.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user sessions with encrypted tokens.
- **Production-Ready Logging**: Balanced logs that support real-time debugging (local) and serverless environments (Vercel).

### 📊 Financial Dashboard
- **Liquidity View**: Aggregated balances across savings and cash.
- **Investment Tracking**: Grouped views for mutual funds, stocks, and fixed deposits.
- **Credit Card Overview**: See all cards with unbilled amounts and upcoming statement dates.
- **Bill Calendar**: Upcoming bills and their due dates.

## 🔄 Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from a previous version, run the database migration:

```bash
cd Backend
alembic upgrade head
```

This will:
- Create `credit_cards` and `bills` tables
- Add new columns to `transactions` table (`is_surety`, `credit_card_id`, `transaction_date`, `is_manual`)
- Backfill `transaction_date` from existing `created_at` values
